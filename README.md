-- Wordy --
Simple dictionary website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client. Includes EJS for templating.

Interacts with two separate APIs: WordsAPI [https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi] and Real Time Image Search [https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-image-search]. It returns information about a word's syllables, pronunciation, definitions, examples, synonyms, antonyms, rhymes, and frequency. The user can search a specific word or a random one. Also, it should show an image that depicts the word in question, but the API's request limit is quite low on the free plan (50/month).

Run it:
1. npm i
2. nodemon index.js

I'm still learning, so please be kind. Though, I'm quite proud of this project: I would like to improve on the design aspect of the pages I build, but this one is quite responsive and neat, albeit simple. So enjoy!
